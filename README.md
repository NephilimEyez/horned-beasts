# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Tue Lab Time Guess and Caveats

Number and name of feature: _Display Images_

Estimate of time needed to complete: _1 hour_

Start time: _5:10_

Finish time: _5:25_

Actual time needed to complete: _15 Minutes_

This was super easy to manipulate yesterdays code. I had to take other things out as it was too much info.

Number and name of feature: _Allow Users to Favorite_

Estimate of time needed to complete: _1 Hour_

Start time: _5:35_

Finish time: _6:30_

Actual time needed to complete: _55 Minutes_

This would have taken less time but again I got lost for 30 minutes trying to find the emoji site only to figure out it was a typing error. I also implemented the favorite and the like here.


Number and name of feature: _Bootstrap, the bain of all that is good__

Estimate of time needed to complete: _2 hours_

Start time: _6:40_

Finish time: _7:10_

Actual time needed to complete: _30 Min_

I did not care for bootstrap. I had to make my code a bit more janky to accomedate it in a pleasing manner
